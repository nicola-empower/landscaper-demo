This is **Eden Landscapes**.

The video establishes a very specific mood: **Serenity, Nature, and Luxury.**
This isn't "Lawn Care" or "Hedge Trimming." This is **Garden Design & Architecture**.

To sell this site for £3k–£5k, you need to convince the landscaper that this website will stop people asking them to "just cut the grass" and start asking for **£50k+ garden transformations**.

### The Persona: "The Landscape Architect"
* **Tone:** Organic, sensory, peaceful, and visionary.
* **The Pitch:** We don't just plant flowers; we extend your living space outdoors.
* **Target Audience:** Wealthy homeowners in Surrey/Guildford who want outdoor kitchens, porcelain patios, and "lifestyle gardens."

Here is the homepage copy for **Eden Landscapes**.
